OPERATING SYSTEM CONFIGURATION

To disable apport and enable core dump detection do the following:

1. Edit /etc/default/apport modify it so that it reads
enabled=0
2. In /etc/sysctl.d create a new file named 60-core-pattern.conf with contents:
kernel.core_pattern = core
3. To apply the changes immediately run:
sudo sysctl --system

To prevent users from reading eachothers files, edit /etc/login.defs, find line
that says:
UMASK		022
and set it to:
UMASK		077


C9 INSTALLATION

1. Clone c9etf repository in a folder, e.g. /usr/local/webide. Note that if you just 
changed the umask, you will have to do something like 

chmod 755 * -R

so that files would be accessible to other users.


2. Copy file lib/config.php.default to lib/config.php and edit it to your needs.
Defaults are just fine for test install.


3. Run install.php. This script will make various changes to your system:

php install.php


4. A user is created on your system named "c9" (or something else that you set in
config.php as $conf_c9_user). Now you need to run Cloud9 as this user and visit 
the web directly so that you could finish the install procedure.
 # su c9
 $ cd /home/c9/fork
 $ nodejs server.js -p 10000 -a : -l YOURIP -w /home/c9/workspace
Instead of YOURIP specify the IP address that you use to reach your server. If 
server started correctly, you can now open
 http://YOURIP:10000/


5. Create a local user named 'admin' so you could access the admin web interface:

/usr/local/webide/bin/webidectl add-local-user admin PASSWORD

Instead of PASSWORD insert the password that you wish to use.


6. Visit webpage
http://yourhost/
http://yourhost/admin.php
