OPERATING SYSTEM CONFIGURATION

To disable apport and enable core dump detection do the following:

1. Edit /etc/default/apport modify it so that it reads
enabled=0
2. In /etc/sysctl.d create a new file named 60-core-pattern.conf with contents:
kernel.core_pattern = core
3. To apply the changes immediately run:
sudo sysctl --system

To prevent users from reading eachothers files, edit /etc/login.defs, find line
that says:
UMASK		022
and set it to:
UMASK		077

Create a "c9" user on your system:
useradd c9


C9 INSTALLATION

1. Clone c9etf repository in a folder, e.g. /usr/local/webide. Note that if you just 
changed the umask, you will have to do something like 

chmod 755 * -R

so that files would be accessible to other users.

2. Copy file lib/config.php.default to lib/config.php and edit it to your needs.
Defaults are just fine for test install.

3. Run install.php:

php install.php

4. Create a local user named 'admin' so you could access the admin web interface:

/usr/local/webide/bin/webidectl add-local-user admin PASSWORD

Instead of PASSWORD insert the password that you wish to use.

5. Visit webpage
http://yourhost/admin.php
